COBWEB

This is a RESPONSIVE HTML5/CSS3 Framework.

Ho Hum, another one.  Nearly.  COBWEB is a little different.  It is intended for COBOL shops that want a RESPONSIVE and SECURE Web prescence, but do not want to go down the long, expensive and tortuous route that is teh Java path, and do not wish to become a PHP or Ruby shop.

The Framework COBWEB is written in STANDARD COBOL.  I use the OPEN COBOL 1.1.0 to develop the system.  Using the COBOL 95 standard the code will compile and run under the IBM COBOL product.  It has a content management system as part of the Framework.

The system uses traditional COBOL files.

INDEX SEQUENTIAL

(spotty kids call this noSQL!!!)

So, in short this package supplies modern web pages that will run on computer browsers, fondleslabs and telephones, whilst retaining a PURE COBOL2 programming environment.
