{"name":"Cobweb","tagline":"A RESPONSIVE HTML5/CSS3 Javascript free Framework for COBOL systems","body":"### COBWEB\r\n\r\n## This is a RESPONSIVE HTML5/CSS3 Framework.\r\n\r\nHo Hum, another one.  Nearly.  **COBWEB** is a little different.  It is intended for COBOL shops that want a _RESPONSIVE and SECURE Web presence_, but do not want to go down the long, expensive and tortuous route that is teh Java path, and do not wish to become a **PHP** or **Ruby** shop.\r\n\r\nThe Framework **COBWEB** is written in STANDARD **COBOL**.  I use the **OPEN COBOL** 1.1.0 to develop the system.  Using the **COBOL** **95** standard the code will compile and run under the **IBM COBOL **product.  It has a content management system as part of the Framework.\r\n\r\nThe system uses traditional COBOL files.\r\n\r\n* SEQUENTIAL\r\n* INDEX SEQUENTIAL\r\n\r\n(spotty kids call this noSQL!!!)\r\n\r\nSo, in short this package supplies modern web pages that will run on computer browsers, fondleslabs and telephones, whilst retaining a PURE **COBOL2** programming environment.\r\n\r\nMark Addinall -  December 2013\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
